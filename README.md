# Harry Potter Trivia

This is a trivia game, based on the Harry Potter movies and books.
There are four basic questions that randomize throughout, so no two games are the same. 
Test your knowledge as you move through the seven years of hogwarts.
If you answer a question correctly, you move up a year. If you answer incorrectly, you move down a year; but be careful so you don't flunk out!
